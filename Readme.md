Creation of dataset
-------------------
The music is 40 min long

The data is organized as such:
Left:
signal_0 = T7 = cortex auditif
signal_1 = C3 = cortex central moteur
signal_2 = CZ = Vertex
signal_3 = RAS
signal_4 = RAS

Right:
signal_0 = T8 = cortex auditif
signal_1 = C4 = cortex central moteur
signal_2 = F4 = cortex frontal
signal_3 = E2 = Yeux
signal_4 = RAS

We manually find with script.py the beginning of the music in the data
Start of music for Louis = 34532
Start of music for Charles = 21189
